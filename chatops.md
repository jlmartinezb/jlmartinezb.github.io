# ChatOps in the Software Life Cycle

Chatops is included within the DevSevOps circuits (https://www.redhat.com/es/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops) and therefore in the software development life cycle or SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle - https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_Development_Life_Cycle

## What is ChatOps ?

**ChatOps** facilitates the automation with a collaboration tool through c interactions. This tool allows developers, operations and support teams to interact to solve any kind of problem or plan a code release, where all the profiles involved in the software use the same tools.

## From Chat to ChatOps 

Chat tools are already very popular in development teams, as slack tools or teams triumph. If you also enrich these tools with the necessary capabilities to integrate them into the software cycle and infrastructure, you get a chatOps solution, so that the simple use of chat to integrate communication to development teams and operations with the automation of operations launched from the chat console (eg launch pipelines, communication of a deployment ends, start and stop machines, generation of support tickets ...)

## Main capabilities of a ChatOps solution

The main functionality is a **chat client**, this chat that can start from one used by impacted teams throughout the SDLC and its extension to all teams involved or the one established within the organization. 

The chat client, must allow **profiling of users**, to group them according to their responsibility (software engineer, engineer Devops ...) with appropriate permissions, and maintaining the principle of separation of responsibilities, given to an engineer Devops different responsibilities of software engineer.

Of course the **authentication based on double facto****r,** must be key in the access to the platform o Security in this kind of tools, such as information encryption, Single Sign On (SSO) with SAML or OAuth support.

This chat, in order to reinforce the principles of a DevSecOps cycle, must allow the launching of tasks, or an automated and enriched interaction, for that it must be added **capabilities of cognitive systems based on Chatbots**/ virtual assistants that improve the interaction, and managing the automation of the task and therefore must provide alternatives to the command line to administer applications, manage tasks and perform administrative tasks, and an open architecture that allows to connect with other systems of the DevSecOps world, such as integration with the most common deployment platforms and technologies that use it-

All this must be accompanied by an asynchronous system of notifications, push type and capacity to be able to be executed both in mobile and web applications to favor the ubiquity of the employee.

## Market tools

Slack and RocketChat or Teams can be tools used within a chatops environment, so

Slack (https://slack.com/intl/es-es/) is the solution by reference, being widely used in development teams, 

Rockechat (https://rocket.chat/), direct competitor of Slack.

Teams (https://products.office.com/es-es/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), is part of Microsoft's office365 ecosystem.
